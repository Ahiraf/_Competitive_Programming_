1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1  <- 1st row (all 1s)
1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1  <- 2nd row (1s on the border, 0s inside)
1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1  <- 3rd row (1s on the border, 0s inside)
..............
..............
1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1  <- (k-1)th row
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1  <- kth row (all 1s)

When flattening this matrix row by row into a string :
First Row : The first k elements of the string will be 1.
Subsequent Rows: The next rows (from 2nd to (k-1)th) will each contribute 1 at the start, followed by kâˆ’2 0s,
and then another 1 at the end.
Last Row: The last k elements of the string will be 1.

Identifying When the First 0 Appears :
The first 0 in the matrix will appear in the second row and the second column. In the flattened string,the first 0 
will appear immediately after the first k 1s (which correspond to the first row).
Thus, the first 0 will be at position k+1 in the flattened string.*/
