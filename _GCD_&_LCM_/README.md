The Euclidean algorithm can be visualized in terms of the tiling analogy given above for the greatest common divisor.
[19] Assume that we wish to cover an a×b rectangle with square tiles exactly, where a is the larger of the two numbers.
We first attempt to tile the rectangle using b×b square tiles; however, this leaves an r0×b residual rectangle untiled, 
where r0 < b. We then attempt to tile the residual rectangle with r0×r0 square tiles. This leaves a second residual rectangle r1×r0, 
which we attempt to tile using r1×r1 square tiles, and so on. The sequence ends when there is no residual rectangle, i.e.,
when the square tiles cover the previous residual rectangle exactly. The length of the sides of the smallest square tile is the 
GCD of the dimensions of the original rectangle. For example, the smallest square tile in the adjacent figure is 21×21 (shown in red), 
and 21 is the GCD of 1071 and 462, the dimensions of the original rectangle (shown in green).
