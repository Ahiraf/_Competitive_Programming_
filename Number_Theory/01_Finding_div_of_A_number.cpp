/*  A number n can have at most 2*sqrt(n) divisors because :

A divisor d of n is a number that divides n without leaving a remainder. For each divisor d of n, there is a corresponding divisor n/d .This means that divisors come in pairs: if 
d is a divisor, then n/d is also a divisor.
For example, if n=36: The divisors are 1,2,3,4,6,9,12,18,36. These divisors can be paired as follows: (1,36),(2,18),(3,12),(4,9),(6,6).

Counting the Divisors : If d <= sqrt(n), then (n/d) >= sqrt(n)

Maximum Number of Divisors :if there are k divisors of n that are less than or equal to sqrt(n). Then, there are also k corresponding divisors that are greater than or equal t
sqrt(n). Thus, the total number of divisors is at most 2k.
  
To find the upper bound on the number of divisors:
k is the number of divisors less than or equal to sqrt(n) Since k must be less than or equal to n, we get k <= sqrt(n).Therefore, the total number of divisors is at most 
2k, and since 𝑘 <= sqrt(n) so it will be 2*sqrt(n).it is the upper limit, not the exact count, so the actual number of divisors can be any number up to this limit.  */
