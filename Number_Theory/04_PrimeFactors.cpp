/* n=a√ób where a <= sqrt(ùëõ) and b‚â• n. If both a and b were greater than sqrt(n),then,a√ób would be greater than 
sqrt(n), which contradicts the assumption that a√ób=n.
Therefore, at least one factor in each pair must be <= sqrt(n) and >= sqrt(n).

//Given a number n. Find all the prime factors of it and their counts

/* Prime Factorisation vs Divisors :
  Prime Factors:Prime factors are factors of a number that are also prime numbers.For example: Prime factors of 12 are 2 and 3 because 
  12=2^2 √ó 3.
 All Divisors: Divisors include all numbers that divide n, not just primes.For example:
 Divisors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12.


=> Factor is often used in the context of multiplication.
=> Divisor is often used in the context of division.
=> In practice, for integers, they refer to the same set of numbers.
