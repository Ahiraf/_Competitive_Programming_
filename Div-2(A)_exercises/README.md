Here I keep my exercise problems which I find interesting and learn something new from.These problems are mainly based on brute force,greedy algorithms, basic math, and implementation, rated from 800 to 1000. 
Anyone who has started their CP journey can find these exercises helpful and can learn easily from them while enjoying solving them.
While I was able to solve some problems on my own, I couldn't solve all of them as I recently started my CP journey.However, I used the editorials from Codeforces to help me understand them thoroughly. 
I have also saved my learnings here and tried to make the explanations as easy as possible.
