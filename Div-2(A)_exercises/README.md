Here I have kept my exercise problems which I found interesting and learned something new from them. These problems are mainly based on brute force, greedy algorithms, basic math, and implementation, rated from 800 to 1200. Anyone who has started their CP journey can find these exercises helpful and can learn easily from them at the same time can enjoy solving them. While I was able to solve some of these problems on my own, I couldn't solve all of them as I recently started my CP journey. However, I used the editorials from Codeforces to help me understand them thoroughly. I have also saved my learnings here and tried to make the explanations as easy as possible.
